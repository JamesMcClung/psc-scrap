# Changelog
Versions are tagged in git. Versioning follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). The API is considerd to include:
- The autofigs yaml configuration format
- The figures generated by autofigs (where a patch-level change would not affect the information a figure contains [i.e., a formatting change], and a minor-level change would increase the information)

## v0.1.0
_April 16, 2024_

Config
- `videos` option now supports `ParticleVariable` identifiers, prefixed with `prt:`

Tweaks
- `bgk/input_reader.py`:
    - If `path_input` points to `*psc/inputs/bgk/*` and it isn't there, guess that it can now be found at `*psc-scrap/inputs/*`

    - Prints frame number during figure generation

Internal
- `bgk/movie.py`:
    - `make_movie`:
        - Added `SnapshotParams` param, subsuming old `FieldData` param
        - Added `nframes` param, required to match `data.nframes` if present (which it might not be, since `FieldData` has `nframes` field but `ParticleData` doesn't)
- `bgk/autofigs/snapshot_generator.py`:
    - `SnapshotParams`:
        - Now generic over `data` field, replacing old `fields` field
        - Added `set_data_only` field, to indicate that the snapshot has been generated once before, and now only existing aritists should be updated
        - Replaced `frame` field with `step`
    - `draw_snapshot` now returns list of artists
- Renamed `bgk/autofigs/snapshot_generators/map.py` to `bgk/autofigs/snapshot_generators/image.py`:
    - Now respects `set_data_only`
- `bgk/particle_data.py`:
    - Added `set_variable` method and `variable` field (no caching related to this, just to match `FieldData` interface)
    - Added `col` method
    - Added `run_manager` field and init param, subsuming `path` field and init param
    - Added `params_record` property, subsuming `inputFile`, `B`, `maxStep`, and `reversed` fields
    - Added `set_step` method and `step` field, used for caching
    - Replaced `t` field with `time` cached property
    - Replaced `_data` field with `data` cached property
    - Made `input` field a cached property
    - Removed `plot_distribution` (replaced by `draw_histogram` snapshot generator)
- `bgk/field_data.py`:
    - Make `params_record` a property
- Added `bgk/autofigs/snapshot_generators/histogram.py`:
    - Contains `draw_histogram` snapshot generator, which plots a particle variable vs. rho
- `bgk/autofigs/sequence.py`:
    - Added `plot_row` method generic over `params` and `snapshot_generator` params, subsuming `plot_row_prt` and `plot_row_pfd`
- `bgk/autofigs/options.py`:
    - `TRIVIAL_FIGURE_TYPES` now includes registered `FigureGenerator` names, but not `videos`

## v0.0.3
_April 2, 2024_

Internal
- `bgk/autofigs/figure_generator.py`:
    - Renamed `image_path_name` param to `figure_name`
